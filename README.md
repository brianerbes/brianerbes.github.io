# Brian Erbes - Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to the official repository for my professional portfolio website. This project is built from scratch and serves as a central hub for my projects, skills, and insights into the world of information security.

## üöÄ Live Site

The portfolio is live and can be viewed at:
**[https://brianerbes.github.io](https://brianerbes.github.io)**

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Modular Design:** Built with a component-based structure using vanilla JavaScript to dynamically load recurring elements like the header and footer. This keeps the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easy to maintain.
* **Clean & Professional UI:** Styled with pure CSS3 for a lightweight, fast, and responsive experience.
* **Project & Blog Sections:** Dedicated pages to showcase hands-on projects and share technical analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For all styling and layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For DOM manipulation and dynamic component loading.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/brianerbes/brianerbes.github.io.git](https://github.com/brianerbes/brianerbes.github.io.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd brianerbes.github.io
    ```
3.  Because the site uses `fetch()` to load components, it needs to be served by a web server to avoid CORS issues. The easiest way is to use a tool like the **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** extension for Visual Studio Code.
    * Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
