                <p>
                    Welcome to my portfolio. I am a Cybersecurity Analyst with a deep-rooted background in technical support and system optimization. My focus is on identifying and mitigating systemic risks before they impact users. I leverage a unique blend of hands-on troubleshooting experience and a strategic, defensive mindset to protect digital environments.
