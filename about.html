                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p style="font-style: italic;">
                    A highly motivated and analytical professional shifting from a top-performing technical support role to a dedicated career in cybersecurity.
                </p>
                
                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    For over two years, I excelled in a dynamic environment at Foundever, supporting the Cash App campaign. In this role, I developed a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of user-facing security challenges. My consistent performance earned me MVP recognition three times in 2024 and provided me with leadership experience as a team coach.

                <h3>From Support to Security</h3>
                <p>
                    While excelling in my role, I began pursuing a degree in Computer Systems Engineering. This academic path, combined with my practical experience, ignited my interest in the defensive side of technology. I realized my core motivation was not just to solve problems as they appeared, but to architect systems to prevent them entirely. This led me to cybersecurity, a field where I can apply my proactive mindset. To formalize my skills, I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, building a strong foundational knowledge in security principles, tools, and best practices.
                </p>

                <h3>Core Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    I operate on the belief that the strongest security posture is built on a foundation of continuous learning, vigilance, and acknowledging that the human element is the most critical variable. As a Cybersecurity Analyst, my objective is to be a reliable and forward-thinking defender of digital assets, leveraging technical acumen to mitigate operational risk.
